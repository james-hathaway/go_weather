To use: On the command line, enter 'go run main.go' followed by a single space. after this, enter the latitude and longitude, separated only by a comma. Example: 'go run main.go "40.4406,-79.9959"  for Pittsburgh.

To create this simple command line application, I took the code I wrote for this application in Rust and rewrote it in Go. I did this to reinforce the cross-language skills I developed while writing the project in Rust. However, as I have become more interested in Go, I wanted to rewrite it to try and use Go.
